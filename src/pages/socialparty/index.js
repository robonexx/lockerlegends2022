          The Roots of Locking are deep in the SOCIAL PARTY SCENE which was
          affected by the civil rights movement. These were originally simply
          called party dances, They existed throughout the 1960s & early
          1970s.These were some of the dances that were featured in the social
          party style seen on the TV dance show “SOUL TRAIN”
        </p>
        <div className={styles.wrapper}>
          <p>
            <span style={{ color: '#ee4e34' }}>The Lock move itself...</span>{' '}
            Was created by Don Campbell as he attempted to do some of the Party
            dances “The Robot Shuffle” or “The Funky Chicken” (Video seen on the
            Soul Train Page) His flavor or style of freezing was termed as
            Locks, But there were other moves , steps, gesture & stunts that
            were in existence before Don put his locking flavor on them & before
            other original generation pioneers added their signature moves to
            the foundation of the dance style.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don Campbell along with others instituted these dances into his
            unique Locking flavor. Combining them with gestures & floor moves ,
            The original dances done in these parties & clubs became social
            party dances , and were popular during the 60s and early 70s.These
            were the basis or foundation by which the Original Pioneers bagan to
            build the many steps of Locking on
          </p>
          <p>
            Like many other terms adapted by this new generation today these
            dances are sometimes referred to as “Soul Dances”.. However, The
            Term Soul Dances refer to the feel or music that existed within the
            1960s Dance scene and Its movement
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>We refer to these as SOCIAL PARTY DANCES, not “Soul” Dances</h2>
        <div className={styles.wrapper}>
          <p>
            Why ? because their initial inception was to be done socially , by
            couples and on a Dance floor in a Social or party setting. It”s
            first involvement was not as performance or competitive dances , but
            Socially were they were used as a social rhythmic language between
            couples to express social conscious music , Like all dances these
            dances was later also used in a competitive nature in couples dance
            contest, another reason that these are referred to as Social Party
            dance are because of there connection to Social conscious music of
            the times. the dances and its music, were inspired by a connection
            to social the issues, of the 1960s & the civil Rights movement.
            These issues were also sung about in social conscious music &
            connected to the bigger SOCIAL movement of the 1960s era..
          </p>
          <p>
            Social or Party dancing involves sharing by leading and following a
            partner, many of these dances inspired songs to be written with
            their names (see below)

            We at Lockerlegends began to teach these Social Party dances and
            steps as a workshop class in Stockholm Sweden in 2005. because we
            saw the need to teach and explain their connection as the root
            within many known Locking steps, for instance:
          </p>
          <p>
            The “Funky Chicken” & (The Robot Shuffle) Known to be in the
            foundational dances which inspired Don Campbell himself to create
            the Lock Move and The Locking style of Dance itself
          </p>
          <p>
            “The breakdown” is the base move for the locking move called the
            sneak or seek ,its also the base for the “stop n Go or the Quicky.
            The Rock steady party dance has the wrist roll & locking hip
            movement within its base,
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className={styles.wrapper_2_col}>
          <p>
            The Jerk is foundational to any hits or chest flexing found in
            Locking & Popping.
            <br />
            <br />
            “The James Brown” as a Dance style & the floor moves are
            inspirational ,to all floor moves used later in Streetdances
            <br />
            <br />
            The Party is very the foundation of the Locking creation, Not the
            performance or Battle. From the party evolved into a Performance ,
            And from those two todays a competitive scene developed..

            This is why we introduced these dances into todays workshops and now
            there are many who have followed our lead and teaching,what they
            call Soul Dance classes, but most have never experienced them in a
            Social Party atmosphere and are unaware of their historical
            significance, so as we say “educate B4U recreate” and that includes
            teaching & workshops, Don’t just see it and imitate it.and teach
            your imitation for profit.. THAT IS CALLED EXPLOITATION… Learn it
            right..
          </p>
          <p>
            AND LEARN TO TEACH HOW & WHY they influenced & became part of
            Locking Listed below are The Social Party Soul Dances which existed
            through the 1960s & early 70s which can be found in the roots of
            Locking.. Learning to dance the dance of Locking ,within the music &
            understanding the feeling of the era is where one can develop Funk &
            soul,,The dances as originally done or sung about were instituted
            into the Locking styles & could be done in different manners, here
            we show the foundation of where they came from, from there every
            party had their renditions of these dances inspired by these songs..
            James Brown in the Video below demonstrates some of the steps below
            that helped into the party dance scene

            NOTE : This video was made in the early 1970s after soul train and
            the dances of Locking and Roboting became popular,James here does
            not just demonstrate dances he made popular, but also does dances
            like the Funky Chicken, where he does a knee drop, and also in this
            video James wrongly introduces his version of Locking or
            Campbellocking as “The Soul Train”, This shows that for most outside
            of the original Los Angeles Movement, Locking was first seen
            nationally in the US in the early to mid 1970s & made famous, when
            seen on the show “Soul Train”Even the early East coast dance scene
            was affected by the early Soul Train movement as illustrated in the
            Movie “Crooklyn” produced by Spike Lee about early 1970s life in
            Brooklyn New York.

            1960s The lyrics in the song by James Brown “There was a Time” (I
            used to dance), tells about the early Party dances that influenced
            the entire dance scene in the early 1960s. many of these dances
            including the splits & alligator floor moves went on to inspire
            other dances including Locking & great dancers such as Michael
            Jackson

            <span style={{ color: '#ee4e34' }}>The Jerk... </span>
            the Jerk had already spawned a craze even before James Brown sung
            about it. It is also very basic flexing move that can be found in
            many of the Locking & popping hits of today , below is the
            inspirational song for the Jerk Dance
          </p>
          <p>
            These 4 party dances & 1 Dance style ( “The James Brown” ) are
            foundational to inspiration of early street dances, Two first two
            were dances (The Jerk & The Twist) were done in the very early
            1960s, and were dance crazes on their own and sung about by other
            artist Like Chubby Checker, The mash potatoes was late 1950s and
            became a craze on the party scene of the 1960″s, The Boogaloo was
            early to mid 1960’s and was a party dance which inspired the
            creation of the popping style called “Boogaloo” By Boogaloo Sam
          </p>
          <p>
            All of these dances evolved into James Browns creative style along
            with is floor moves ,spins & splits, throughout the mid to late
            1960’s many party dancers imitated “James Browns style , Just as
            they did Michael Jacksons style through out the 80s & 90s this shows
            how dances
