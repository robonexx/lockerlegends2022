              Locking or Campbellocking is a dance art form with improvisational
              move called the lock. These were created by Don Campbell and put
              to a specific rhythm and style in the nightclubs of Los Angeles in
              the early 1970s.

              This dance and subculture quickly caught on and was soon the rage
              of a new television dance show called Soul Train. Individual
              dancers displayed quick locking and pointing movements along with
              hand slaps and splits.

            In 1972 The Go-Go brothers (Tony and Buddy along with the Original
            Skeeter Rabbitt & Kevin YoYo ) combined to form the first
            synchronized locking dance group; performing skits and routines in
            both large arenas as well as small high school functions.
            <br />
            In late 1972, early 1973 Scooby Doo and Greg Campbellock Jr.
            combined with the Go- Go Brothers (Tony & Buddy), Skeeter Rabbitt
            (OG) and with female lockers Arnetta Johnson, Lorna Dune & Shelly
            Cepeda formed the first unisex Locking group called, “Creative
            Generation“. This group studied dance, taught, performed and toured
            as members of the Legendary Watts Writers Workshop. Later that
            summer,Is when Don Campbell along with Toni Basil organized and
            introduced the group, “THE LOCKERS”( originally named the
            campbellock dancers after Don Campbell’s first group). “The Lockers”
            was one of the most dynamic, influential groups in the history of
            the dance, comprising both improvisational dancers and synchronized
            dancers to form a group who could attract the culturally diverse
            ,COMMERCIAL audiences
            <br />
            <br />
            Greg “Cambellock Jr” Pope , Had left the Watts writers first group
            “Creative Generation” and helped introduced to the group (The
            Lockers), synchronized locking choreography, which he had learned
            during his Creative Generation experience, at the Watts Writers
            Workshop. Him along with Don Campbell, “Slim Robot”, Fred “Rerun”
            Berry, Fluky Luke, Trained Ballerina & Chorographer Toni Basil,
            along with a young new talent, from Chicago Adolfo “Shabba Doo”
            Quinones. The Dance style of Locking went from just a style to a
            performance artform, and was NOW revealed to the world.
            <br />
            <br />
            During the Original groups existence, in the early 70’s. Other OG
            dancers such as Tony Go-Go and “The Original Skeeter Rabbit” (James
            Higgins)were members who were added and danced as OFFICIAL
            ALTERNATES with the Original Official Group The Lockers,
            <br />
            <br />
            Many dancers have claimed original status ,some even taking pictures
            at events at mavericks today , or at Soul Train reunion Parties, and
            THEY ARE NOT. They may have danced on soul train or went to the
            clubs AFTER that original era , but they want you to think they were
            there right along with the REAL OG’s & they were not original. YES
            they may have been good, and may have done great commercial stuff
            ,but many of them were not back there on that original scene ,when
            locking FIRST developed. we have mentioned most who was & we
            clarified most who were around durng other time periods. if you were
            on the ORIGINAL scene and are not mentioned we would be happy to
            include you , If you want to know who was and who wasn’t just ask ,
            we will post and clarify your confusion… ORIGINAL means ORIGINAL,
            <br />
            <br />
            Please take note : All the way up into the 80s the group The LOCKERS
            was reconstructed many times with various dancers added or dropped
            as members.( see some of the later groups)As the group went through
            many personal & professional transitions, many of the dancers added
            in that time span , were not original era dancers and were not added
            on an OFFICIAL level, but they did dance with various original
            members under the assumption they were dancing with “THE ORIGINAL
            LOCKERS” BEWARE of all of those claiming to have been there !
            <br />
            <br />
            Also, during the early to mid 70s period other urban groups such as
            33RPM and the Ghetto Dancers were also formed (see acknowledgement
            page). These were comprised of various combinations of other old
            school locking (dancers) pioneers. Once the dance was introduced on
            National Television, It set off a dance phenomenon which now began
            spreading from the Los Angeles inner city, to the once segregated
            Suburbs, of Orange County the once segregated surrounding areas,(
            this is how other dancers of different generation came about) And
            eventually the style was seen and began to be imitated across the
            Country. Some of these newly found admirers of the style found
            themselves exposed to the ORIGINAL movement and Identified with the
            Original Foundation, Because the Dance style of Locking had ONLY
            been exposed through site.The Original Culture ,History and
            Foundation was only passed on to those that lived or sought the
            inner city experience.The discovery of the Newly discovered “Dance
            style” enticed supburban groups, promoters, dancers and managers,
            who were normally segregated to flood the scene . Some were driven
            by the love, facination and respect for the artform. Others simply
            ignored any foundatition and only disired to exploit an artform to a
            commercial market. Many of these dancers and groups, who bypassed
            the Foundation to simply imitate the moves as they thought they saw
            them, they were known by the real street sub-culture simply as “SLOP
            lockers”.
            <br />
            <br />
            Note: Many of these groups and individules quickly clammered to
            exploit not just the artform of locking but it’s entire culture and
            roots. Many renamed steps and plagerized entire taped routines. Some
            never learned the internal rules of the sub-culture. They never
            learned or inquired about the brotherhood which made locking great.
            They only attemped to capitalize, exploit and alter the history of
            locking.
            <br />
            <br />
            Many don’t understand what the History &; background has to do with
            the dance of Locking, Many wonder why it just can’t be a dance
            style, show or circus act..WATCH this video WATTS STAX and see what
            the inspiration was and still is for those that KEEP IT REAL
            <br />
            <br />
            By 1973 there were an excess of pioneers known as lockers who made
            their name and reputations in the urban communities and night clubs.
            The few known as the Original members of “The Lockers Group” became
            the internationally famous. But ORIGINAL Dancers Like Guy
            “Shocklock” Evans, Jeffery “Cat Man” Macintire, Eugene “F&M”
            Henderson, Roy “Lie Lock”, “Sneaky T”, Enock “Elmer Fudd”, John
            “Okiedoke” Wilson “Elmer Fud’ Smith (RIP), , Steve “Sinbad” Crane,
            Arnetta “Nettabug” Johnson,Greg “Capt Crunch” Dandridge, Fredi Maxie
            and several others were some of the Street legends, who contributed.
            <br />
            <br />
            By the mid 1970s locking had now been seen by many, and was now
            spreading. Southern California now had the Originating movement, but
            the dance now had migrated from the Inner city to suburban areas,
            such as Orange County California, where some of the originals were
            now accepted and shared the dance style with locals in that area,
            and to the Ventura Valley where those that seen an imitated the
            dance style open the doors to other eyes. But the Original style
            continued to develop in the Southern California Hoods of Watts,
            South Central , Compton and Inglewood, with Other 80s groups and Old
            School legends who bridged the gap between Locking and Popping
            <br />
            <br />
            There were many who danced as members of the group “The Lockers” and
            many more who are refered to as Lockers by virtue of the dance of
            locking, which they have represented
            <br />
            <br />
            In 1974 Jimmy “Scoobydoo Foster toured with a group called
            “Something Special’ introducing Locking along with various other
            dances internationally , into Japan,
            <br />
            <br />
            By 1975 the artform had evolved both socially and professionally and
            in the late 1970’s, “The Original Lockers Group disbanded” and a
            third generation was formed in the mid 1980’s, adding old school
            pioneer “Alpha“Anderson,(who created the alpha floor move) along
            with old schoolers from the mid 70s, Lewis “Deputy” Green, Lionel
            “Big D” Douglas“and Anna “Lollipop” Sanchez, and 2nd generation GoGo
            brothers Manny “Loose Caboose” Tristin this formed the third
            generation “LOCKERS” Group. In the mid 1970’s Jimmy Scooby do Foster
            and a Group called “Something Special “was the first to
            internationally expose Asia to Locking along with other Cultural
            social dances. In the Late 70s Watts groups, such as the second
            generation of Kaptin Krunch (Charles Washington of the FBs) and his
            Funky Bunch followed the legacy of the Inner City Streets, by
            performing on Soul Train and in the 80s and as members of the
            Lockers in a 1984 performance, dancing both Locking & Popping. By
            the mid 1980’s, Tony Go-Go Lewis established a school re-introducing
            the locking dance art in Japan. Today, there is a wave of interest
            to know and understand the history and sub-culture of a true dance
            phenomenon all over the world.
            <br />
            <br />
            By no means were these the only groups or contributors ( There are
            so many) to this dance and subculture that helped to form the multi
            style and cultures of today’s hip hop History of anything begans
            with an inspiration and an action, The inspiration of the artform
            came from a struggle of a people, the and action was put into place
            by Don Campbell, The early history stims from this one person
            through a group of early contributors to a specific area at a
            specific time in history,The innercity of South central Los Angeles,
            Watts & Compton California will always be that inception point in
            history, the issues surrounding those times will always be the
            inspiration.from there it insited a streetdance movement with
            purpose and pride. Today when one speaks of Locking history it can
            include many points of exposure to the style and all create an ever
            expanding chapter Many thanks to Don Campbell and the many other Old
            and New School pioneers.
            <br />
            <br />
            Many ask why can’t Locking just be an act like the circus, why can’t
            it just be entertainment , well it can be entertainment, but not
            like clowns, or minstril , it means much more check out the video
            below, soul and funk music linked to what the influences was that
            made this dance great
