#  LockerLegends website 2022 `#ffc13b`

## ![#ff6e40] Exam project and a live site rebuilding the lockerlegends.net site, still old site up will be switced to this latest 19th of may `#ff6e40

**So this is my exam project at KYH, I decided to rebuild the lockerlegends website.**

## Opportunity to give back

### Why did I choose this project?

Well James Higgins is the owner of the website and he is a pioneer old school Soul-train dancer and locker, representing the artform of locking aka Campbellocking.
He has always shared his knowledge and is the first one who actually had an informative page about the pioneers, history, steps and so on online.
James has always given his time for the people who have shown interest and many times put in hours of his free time to teach and travel.

So for me a chance of giving back to a person who has helped me in my carreer and been teaching me since 2005, his knowledge is a reason I had a great carreer as a dancer. 

### What is the goal?

The goal is to be able to use / implement everything ive learned since fall 2020 when this education started. 
Its my exam so I have to use the different subjects we had during this education, try to get something from every part of the curriculum.

Web development techniques, UX and working methodologies.

## The problem to solve

Well the website has not been updated the past probably 10 years, it´s done in wordpress and has a lot of bugs in it that needs to be fixed.
It´s hard to navigate and read due to a lot of contect being plain text with out sepration of any kind. 
The UI is outdated. The owner cant upload images in to wordpress, code is missing. 
The average visitor statistic is 1-2 pages per visitor, lasting from 30s-2min. In other words something is needed to be done. 
A lot of spam to be removed with over 9000 comments, and there is no comment section open?

## How I will try to solve it and build this site?

So I desided to rebuild the page from scratch, I have downloaded the DB and started a new WP project locally. 
I will then restructure it in WP first so it can be used as a CMS
I will build all pages in NEXT.JS that is not going to have any changes
Use posts in WP as the dynamic 'pages' that the customer will use as a cms
Use headless cms in NEXT.js to get the data from wp
Use siteground and make a subdomain for use as the wp site
Then use NEXT and vercel to have the website on.

# Issues

- Built the site using Styled components first and it was a bit of a learning curve to get it working,
I dident like that the page got slow and I decided to switch to 

- importing images, solved with the help of ... 

- Nav not closing in NEXT due to it being serverside rendered

Next.js images, links, useEffect problems with useRef, got it working eventually
